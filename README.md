**Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard - Power BI Project**

**Project Overview**

This Power BI dashboard project visualizes and analyzes Emergency Room (ER) patient data for a hospital covering the period from April 2023 through October 2024. The dashboard provides insights into patient visits, wait times, demographics, admission status, and departmental referrals to help hospital management optimize patient flow and resource allocation.

**Business Objectives**

- Monitor monthly and daily patient volumes and identify peak hours and days.
- Analyze average patient wait times to improve ER efficiency.
- Understand patient demographics including age, gender, and race for better care planning.
- Track patient admission status and departmental referrals.
- Measure patient satisfaction scores and identify areas needing improvement.

**Data Sources and Structure**

- Patient visit records including timestamps, admission status, demographics, and referral details.
- Aggregated data on patient wait times and satisfaction ratings.
- Data segmented by month, day, hour, patient age groups, gender, race, admission status, and departments.

**Key Dashboard Features**

**Views and Navigation**

- Monthly View: Overview of total patient visits, average wait times, admission rates, and satisfaction scores.
- Patient View: Detailed patient-level data including age, gender, race, admission status, and department referrals.
- Report View: Performance metrics summaries with trends and visual breakdowns.

**Visual Analytics**

- Trends in patient visits by month and day.
